### Summary of Federated Learning (FL) Framework Evaluation

All five FL frameworks evaluated `FedML`, `Flower`, `FATE`, `TensorFlow Federated (TFF)`, and `PySyft` offer a broad spectrum of features and flexibility for building FL systems. Below is a summary of their performance based on an equal-weighted average evaluation:

- **FedML**: Ranked as the top-performing framework. It stands out due to its practical, real-world-focused tutorials and an orchestration platform that supports controlling FL experiments from a centralised website. This makes it an ideal choice for comprehensive real-world FL scenarios.
  
- **Flower and FATE**: Both frameworks closely follow `FedML` in terms of performance. They are robust options for setting up FL experiments, thanks to their seamless deployment and intuitive tutorials that cater to various FL settings.
  
- **TFF and PySyft**: While both frameworks are designed with FL in mind, the evaluation determined that `TFF` and `PySyft` are more geared toward academic research. Their tutorials are primarily focused on proofs of concept, making them less practical for large-scale real-world FL deployments compared to the other frameworks.

### Conclusion

Despite their varying strengths, all five FL frameworks are open-source, providing a flexible foundation that can be enhanced and customized to suit specific project requirements. This open-source nature allows for the integration of unique features tailored to different FL use cases.
